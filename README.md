## What Does a Data Engineer Do?
Given its varied skill set, a data engineering role can span many different job descriptions. A data engineer can be responsible for database design, schema design, creating multiple database solutions and creating pipelines. This work might also involve a Database Administrator.

As a data engineer, you might act as a bridge between the database (or datalake) and the data science teams. In that case, you’ll be responsible for data cleaning and preparation, as well. If big data is involved, then it’s your job to come up with an efficient solution for that data.

You’ll also need to make efficient data queries for reporting and analysis. You might need to interact with multiple types of databases or write Stored Procedures and also data sources. For many solutions like high-traffic websites or services, there may be more than one database present. In these cases, the data engineer is responsible for setting up the databases, maintaining them, and transferring data between them.
