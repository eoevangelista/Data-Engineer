# Overview

## In this exercise I will build a data pipeline that extracts data in MongoDB in the cloud and in the IBGE API, depositing it in an AWS Data Lake. After ingesting data at Data Lake, I will make the treated and filtered data available only to the public of interest. With the data in the database, I will make some queries.
